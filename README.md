# FTCScouter

This is a scouting app for FIRST Tech Challenge as a part of [Hack Clubs Flavortown Event](https://flavortown.hackclub.com)

It's pretty easy to use! Just enter the event code which you can find from the [FTC Events Web](https://ftc-events.firstinspires.org/#allevents) and you can see all teams! Creation of rows and columns is done through the plus symbols.

## Alliance Creation

The fields at the bottom are used for selecting your alliances where you are able to input each tumber and their respective side!
